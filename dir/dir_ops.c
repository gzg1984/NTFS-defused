 * long is 32-bits. This is the most we can do for now without overflowing the
 * page cache page index. Doing it this way means we don't run into problems
 * because of existing too large directories. It would be better to allow the
 * user to read the accessible part of the directory but I doubt very much
 * anyone is going to hit this check on a 32-bit architecture, so there is no
 * point in adding the extra complexity required to support this.
 *
 * On 64-bit architectures, the check is hopefully optimized away by the
 * compiler.

 * ntfs_dir_fsync - sync a directory to disk
 * @filp:	directory to be synced

 * @datasync:	if non-zero only flush user data and not metadata
 *
 * Data integrity sync of a directory to disk.  Used for fsync, fdatasync, and
 * msync system calls.  This function is based on file.c::ntfs_file_fsync().
 *
 * Write the mft record and all associated extent mft records as well as the
 * $INDEX_ALLOCATION and $BITMAP attributes and then sync the block device.
 *
 * If @datasync is true, we do not wait on the inode(s) to be written out
 * but we always wait on the page cache pages to be written out.
 *
 * Note: In the past @filp could be NULL so we ignore it as we don't need it
 * anyway.
 *
 * Locking: Caller must hold i_mutex on the inode.
 *
 * TODO: We should probably also write all attribute/index inodes associated
 * with this inode but since we have no simple way of getting to them we ignore
 * this problem for now.  We do write the $BITMAP attribute if it is present
 * which is the important one for a directory so things are not too bad.
